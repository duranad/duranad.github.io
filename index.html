            <h3>May 2025: Big updates, big news! MathWarmer 1.6</h3>
            <p>It's been quite a while since you've heard from MathWarmer. That doesn't mean we've been hibernating however. Quite the opposite. Since last year's summer, we've been very busy! There hasn't been a single day and week where immense amount of work hasn't been put into this project. There was no corner cut, no compromise was made. Several thousand lines of code were written, recycled, written and polished to deliver something new. Something very special.</p>
            <p>The goal for MathWarmer has been clear from the start. Make math more appealing, more playful, easier for everyone to fall in love with it. Do you remember when you were young, it was Friday or Saturday night, but instead of partying outside, you were sitting behind your new gaming computer? Instead of playing the newest Crisis, Assassins creed or League of Legends, something had peaked your interest! Earlier that day, you had thought of something... something that made you want answers! How does a pump work? Why is the sky blue? How does a mirror see an apple behind a piece of paper? These questions made you restless. You wanted to know the truht! </p>
            <p>This is what we are trying to capture with MathWarmer! Interest. That's the only right way to learn math. Why is Euler considered one of the best mathematicians to ever have lived? Why was James Clerk Maxwell able to compute complex integrals in his head? Was he taught? A little, maybe... But he SAW. He saw them in his head, in ways we cannot even imagine, because he mastered all the basic and advanced math enough and that made him saw it. He saw patterns with primes, odd and even numbers which allowed him to think way forward, way into the "future."</p>
            <p>Now, in the digital age, in the age of gaming, we have an ideal oportunity to change the way we approach learning math. Why is an 13 year old child able to beat you at your favourite online game? It's the passion for game which makes it better. We all have our lives, responsibilities, struggles we keep on thinking every... single... day. However young people are often able to beat us at these games. Because they put immense time into them, because they are passionate about it and nothing, even their parents can stop them. They weren't forced to do so, they didn't need teachers or long seminars... something about those games peaked their interest. That interest made learning almost seamless and mastery better than all of us.</p>
            <p>Imagine if we could peak interest of people like this with math! Imagine a game, or games which would make people passionate about math. Imagine if people would be able to learn math principles and rules as passionately! If you think that is impossible, that math is too complex for this, we disagree! How is learning 200 champions, builds, runes and combinations of buffs, level stats, level updates and heals any less challenging than remembering math laws?</p>
            <p>This is what drives us MathWarmer. A world where 13 year old beats you seamlessly in math, with all the disrespect that games have!</p>
            <p>These are big goals and big goals need to be accomplished by thousands of small steps. We are proud to accomplish one of these in our new update 1.6!</p>
            <h4>Introducing: CurveGuessr</h5>
            <p>With CurveGuessr mode, we took the big goal to the next level. Until now, the game modes were simple, almost text based, even if necessary basics. CurveGuessr is something new. Something fresh. Something we are very proud of. Let's start from the beginning.</p>
            <p>CurveGuessr name is pretty self-explanatory. It's about guessing curve equations. In this mode, user - player receives a proceduraly generated curve and his goal is to guess its equation, in typical MathWarmer fashion -> just by looking at it!</p>
            <h5>Basics</h5>
            <p>Geometry is great part of math. Sports games, racing games and quick action games with rapid 3-dimensinal movement have already proven themselves with improving the 3d space awarness. CurveGuessr takes this approach and adds the math to it! It connects the vision of geometry by seeing the curve and builds the connection by demanding the player to guess its equation on the go, using just his eyes and head.</p>
            <p>As mentioned before, much more resources were put into the graphic design. It's just as important as the idea itself. There is no engagement without captivating design. That's why the whole game mode is designed as a compact hand-held console from the 80s, with a cyberpunk twist: crystal-like buttons and black displays with bright neon text, lines and borders!</p>
            <p>Keeping the MathWarmer spirit, player will get his results after each round. To also introduce a learning curve, player can adjust his difficulty with various graphic aids. Not to worry, players can introduce themselves to the game with a compehensive tutorial.</p>
            <p>Both the CurveGuessr mode and the tutorial are available in MathWarmer 1.6.</p>
            <h5>Future</h5>
            <p>It looks bright with CurveGuessr and it's not just the neon lights! For now, CurveGuessr is available for players to train themselves with lines and their equations. In the next big update, other curves will be added: Parabolae, Hyperbolae, Elipses, Circles, Harmonic functions and much more! Stay tuned!</p>
            <p>Until then, keep your math skills warm with MathWarmer and see you next time.</p>
